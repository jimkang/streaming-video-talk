<div>
- Streaming
- What is it?
  - Getting data to from one point to another, one small chunk at a time
  - e.g. Data processing tool and memory
  - On demand
  - Mechanical term "back pressure" (flow reduction, not actually reverse pressure)
</div>
<div>
- The state of streaming video
- Things that happen with "progressive download" right now
  - Firefox freezing
    - Too much to handle at a time
- Too long of a wait for first frame on some connections
</div>
<div>

- How can *you* get streaming video?
  - HTML 5 video is here, right?
  - video.js &mdash; via Flash.
    - Link to confirmation here.
  - JWPlayer - via Flash only.

</div>
<div>

  - How can you get it without Flash?
    - YouTube
      - Screenshot of DevTools
    - Netflix
      - Screenshot of DevTools
      - Not open source
</div>
<div>

    - Not open source
    - Safari and Mobile Safari support HLS (a kind of streaming video) natively
      - Markup here
    - Chrome on Android supports HLS, but NOT Chrome on desktop
      - I wonder why?
</div>
<div>

  - So where can we go for this?
    - There's two major standards for streaming video in the browser: HLS and DASH
    - Both
        - Media broken into separate files
        - Adaptive bitrate
</div>
<div>
        
    - HLS
      - m3u8
      - ts files
      - Apple-created
</div>
<div>
    - DASH
      - Sort of supported natively in Firefox from versions 21-23 (then removed)
      - Has quite a few members: http://dashif.org/members/
      - Reference implementation is not robust: https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/dash.
</div>
<div>
    &mdash; Differ in the way chunks are broken, encoded, and read.
</div>
<div>
  &mdash; How can we implement either?
    &mdash; We know how to download file chunks.
</div>
<div>
    &mdash; But <video> just takes a src attribute.
      &mdash; MediaSource extensions
      &mdash; Lets you create a SourceBuffer
      &mdash; SourceBuffer allows you to append chunks.
</div>
<div>
    &mdash; Encode with Bento
      &mdash; https://github.com/harvard-dce/encode-for-mediasource
    &mdash; Reference implementation:
